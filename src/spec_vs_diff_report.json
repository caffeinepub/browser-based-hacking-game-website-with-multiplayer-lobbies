  "summary": "Diff adds Solo initialization progress utilities (phase messages + elapsed-time formatter + timeout helper) and a tightened, bounded lobby-readiness polling strategy with faster early retries (50ms initial delay). SoloGamePage is updated to track elapsed time during initialization and to use the new readiness polling helpers, but the truncated diff does not conclusively show the final UI behavior for Retry/Back controls and the exact rendering/disappearance rules for elapsed time.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-54",
      "requirement": "Solo Mode still transitions to INITIALIZATION_FAILED with Retry/Back controls if the lobby never becomes ready within the configured bounds/timeout.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet for SoloGamePage is truncated before showing the error/failed-state rendering and controls. While the polling function returns null on timeout/cancellation, the evidence provided does not confirm the UI transitions to an explicit failure state with Retry/Back controls.",

      "id": "REQ-55",
      "requirement": "The elapsed-time display updates while initialization is in progress and disappears once the terminal is ready or the error state is shown.",
      "reason": "There is clear evidence of an interval updating elapsedMs during initState === 'initializing', but the render logic that shows/hides the elapsed-time text based on ready/error states is not included in the truncated SoloGamePage diff.",
