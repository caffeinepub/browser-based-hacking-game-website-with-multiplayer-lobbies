  "summary": "REQ-22 is largely implemented by adding the requested Google Search Console HTML verification file under frontend/public. However, the file content shown in the diff appears to include a trailing newline/blank line, which may violate the requirement that the response body be exactly the specified string. The diff also includes unrelated frontend changes (routing/UI/hooks/etc.) that were not requested for this task.",

      "reason": "The added static file content in the diff shows an extra trailing newline/blank line after the verification string, so the body may not be byte-for-byte identical to the required string.",
